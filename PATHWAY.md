Yes. The conversation drifted from **“build the OpenAlex of Sanskrit and premodern texts”** into spending most of our attention on whether an event table can survive database destruction.

That durability work matters, but it is not the product.

The clean reset is:

> **OpenPāṭala is the public data infrastructure. Pāṭala is everything intelligent that grows on top of it.**

OpenPāṭala should become the canonical open graph/API answering:

> **What is this work? What other databases know it? Who wrote it? What witnesses, scans, editions, e-texts, translations and scholarship exist? Where can I access them? What is uncertain or disputed? What is still missing?**

That is the product you can take to market.

And the bigger Pāṭala vision then plugs into it:

```text
                    OPENPĀṬALA
        canonical reality/data infrastructure
                         │

                         ▼
                    OpenPāṭala
```

That is the full vision.

# 1. What `wiggly` can actually do today

Ignoring README claims and judging the code itself, it is currently a **prototype vertical metadata graph with the beginnings of an OpenAlex-style API**.

It can already expose:

```text
GET /v1/works
GET /v1/works/{id}
GET /v1/works/{id}/assertions
GET /v1/bundle/{id}
GET /v1/resolve?q=
GET /v1/search?q=
GET /v1/changes
GET /v1/people
GET /v1/institutions
GET /v1/editions
GET /v1/witnesses
GET /v1/etexts
...
```

The bundle endpoint already attempts to assemble a Work dossier containing editions, witnesses, e-texts, translations, passages, assertions, provenance and completeness. **That is much closer to the real product than the replay machinery we've been obsessing about.**

There is also an extremely important primitive hiding in plain sight: `WorkCompleteness`.

It already models:

```text
identity
source
translation
alignment
evaluation
bibliography
```

and the idea that OpenPāṭala should become a **map of holes**.

That is potentially one of the core differentiators of the whole company/project.

The current ingestion system can discover records through adapters, normalize metadata into candidate assertions, run rudimentary identity matching, and populate Works/assertions/external IDs. But it currently collapses too much into Work records and doesn't yet make Artifact → Observation → Candidate → Entity the universal ingest flow.

The repository also contains the schema vocabulary for a much richer graph—witnesses, editions, e-texts, translations, source providers, observations, candidates, identity assertions, etc.

So you are **not at zero**.

You have roughly:

> **the skeleton of OpenPāṭala, populated with some data, but not yet the actual OpenPāṭala product.**

---

# 2. What it absolutely cannot do yet

If I type:

> `Tantrāloka`

the system should eventually answer something like:

```text
Tantrāloka
Pāṭala ID: ...

Attributed author
  Abhinavagupta
  confidence: high
  evidence: ...

Alternative titles
  ...
  
External identities
  PANDiT: ...

  Archive.org: ...
  etc.

OpenPāṭala coverage

  Manuscripts     ██████░░░░
  Editions        █████████░
  Translation     ████░░░░░░
  Scholarship     ███████░░░

Missing
  English translation of āhnikas X–Y
  4 manuscript identities unresolved
  edition X has no digital surrogate
```

Today `wiggly` cannot reliably produce that.

Its `/search` is essentially substring matching over titles, `/resolve` is exact-title matching, and `/frontier/translations` currently labels every Work `NONE_KNOWN`.

`CompletenessCompiler` currently makes simplistic inferences—for example treating the presence of DOI/OpenAlex identifiers as enough to label bibliography `COMPLETE`.

That is what should change next.

---

# 3. What “rival OpenAlex” should mean

Do **not** try to rival OpenAlex at its own horizontal game.

OpenAlex currently describes a graph of hundreds of millions of scholarly entities and billions of relationships. It aggregates records from Crossref, ORCID, ROR, PubMed, repositories and web sources, disambiguates those records, and exposes the resulting graph through Web, REST API and bulk snapshots. ([OpenAlex Help Center][1])

Its product lesson is more important than its scale.

OpenAlex has extremely predictable developer ergonomics:

```text
/{entity}
/{entity}/{id}

?search=
?filter=
?sort=
?select=
?group_by=
?sample=
?page=
?cursor=
```

plus autocomplete, external-ID resolution, snapshots and changefiles. ([OpenAlex][2])

**Copy that discipline.**

But OpenPāṭala's graph is different.

OpenAlex:

```text
Publication
  ↕
Author
  ↕
Institution
  ↕
Source
  ↕
Citation
```

OpenPāṭala:

```text
                     WORK
                      │
       ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
       ▼              ▼              ▼
    PERSON         EDITION        WITNESS
                      │              │
                      ▼              ▼
                    ETEXT        SURROGATE
                      │              │
                      └──────┬───────┘
                             ▼
                          PASSAGE
                             │
                ┌────────────┼────────────┐
                ▼            ▼            ▼
           TRANSLATION   SCHOLARSHIP   ASSERTION
                │                         │
                ▼                         ▼
           ALIGNMENT                   EVIDENCE
```

That is substantially richer for textual scholarship.

---

# 4. The actual OpenPāṭala positioning

I would make the public description brutally simple:

> **OpenPāṭala is the open graph of premodern texts.**

Secondary sentence:

> Search works across fragmented catalogues and discover their manuscripts, editions, digital texts, translations and scholarship through one API.

Not:

> epistemic event-sourced autonomous scholarly state machine.

That can be true internally.

Nobody should need to understand it to use your API.

---

# 5. The canonical entity model

I would freeze the public domain model around about ten first-class entities.

```text
Work
Person
Institution
Witness
Surrogate
Edition
Text
Translation
ScholarlyWork
Passage
```

Then infrastructure entities remain accessible through specialist endpoints:

```text
Provider
Artifact
Observation
Assertion
Evidence
IdentityDecision
RightsAssessment
Activity
```

The critical distinction:

```text
Work ≠ Edition ≠ Witness ≠ Text ≠ Translation
```

This is where OpenPāṭala can crush generic bibliographic systems.

For example:

```text
Abhinavagupta's Work
        │
        ├─ Witness A
        │    └─ IIIF surrogate
        │
        ├─ Witness B
        │
        ├─ Edition 1918
        │    └─ digitized scan
        │
        ├─ Edition 1964
        │    └─ GRETIL e-text
        │
        ├─ English translation X
        │
        └─ 73 scholarly publications
```

---

# 6. One important correction to our previous schema obsession

**Do not expose the assertion/event model as the normal API representation.**

Permanent internal truth can absolutely be:

```text
observations
+ events
+ assertions
+ provenance
```

But developers want:

```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "display_name": "Tantrāloka",
  "authors": [...],
  "languages": ["san"],
  "texts_count": 4,
  "witnesses_count": 31,
  "translations_count": 3
}
```

OpenAlex does the same conceptual thing: consumers interact primarily with convenient entity records, not its ingestion internals. Its API and snapshot use consistent entity-shaped records. ([OpenAlex][2])

Therefore:

```text
Permanent epistemic model
        ↓
Projection compiler
        ↓
Beautiful developer records
```

---

# 7. The canonical `Work` API record

I would make `/works/{id}` roughly:

```json
{
  "id": "https://patala.org/e/019...",
  "type": "work",

  "display_name": "Tantrāloka",

  "titles": [
    {
      "text": "Tantrāloka",
      "language": "san",
      "script": "Latn",
      "type": "preferred"
    }
  ],

  "authorships": [
    {
      "person": {
        "id": "...",
        "display_name": "Abhinavagupta"
      },
      "status": "supported"
    }
  ],

  "languages": ["san"],

  "date": {
    "earliest": 975,
    "latest": 1025,
    "certainty": "approximate"
  },

  "traditions": [
    {"id": "...", "display_name": "Trika"}
  ],

  "external_ids": {
    "pandit": "...",
    "gretil": "...",
    "wikidata": "..."
  },

  "counts": {
    "witnesses": 0,
    "surrogates": 0,
    "editions": 0,
    "texts": 0,
    "translations": 0,
    "scholarship": 0,
    "passages": 0
  },

  "availability": {
    "source": "etext",
    "translation": {
      "eng": "partial"
    },
    "manuscripts": "known",
    "bibliography": "partial"
  },

  "best_text": {...},
  "best_translation": {...},

  "coverage": {
    "identity": "resolved",
    "source": "etext",
    "translation": "partial",
    "bibliography": "partial"
  },

  "created_at": "...",
  "updated_at": "...",
  "state_cursor": 123456
}
```

Normal clients get this.

Scholarly/agent clients can request:

```text
?include=assertions,evidence,provenance
```

---

# 8. The killer endpoint is still `/bundle`

This is where OpenPāṭala becomes more valuable than merely cloning OpenAlex.

```http
GET /v1/works/{id}/bundle
```

returns:

```text
Work
People
Titles
Identity evidence
Witnesses
Surrogates
Editions
Texts
Translations
Scholarship
Passage map
Rights
Coverage
Open gaps
Provenance
```

Your existing `/bundle/{id}` is already aiming toward exactly this.

Make it excellent.

This endpoint alone becomes spectacular for agents.

---

# 9. Copy OpenAlex's query language almost deliberately

Don't invent strange developer ergonomics.

OpenAlex supports search, filter, sort, `select`, `group_by`, pagination and external-ID lookup across entity endpoints. ([OpenAlex][2])

OpenPāṭala should support:

```http
GET /v1/works?search=abhinavagupta
```

```http
GET /v1/works?filter=language:san
```

```http
GET /v1/works?filter=author.id:PT...,translation.eng:none
```

```http
GET /v1/works?filter=has_text:true,translation.eng:none
```

```http
GET /v1/works?filter=tradition:trika,has_witness:true
```

```http
GET /v1/works?sort=scholarship_count:desc
```

```http
GET /v1/works?group_by=translation.eng
```

```http
GET /v1/works?select=id,display_name,availability
```

```http
GET /v1/works?cursor=...
```

This reduces adoption friction for anyone already familiar with OpenAlex.

---

# 10. External-ID resolution should be ridiculously good

OpenAlex allows direct lookup through DOI, ORCID, ROR and related IDs. ([OpenAlex][2])

OpenPāṭala should do:

```http
GET /v1/works/gretil:sa_abhinava-tantraloka
GET /v1/works/pandit:12345
GET /v1/people/orcid:...
GET /v1/institutions/ror:...
```

And:

```http
GET /v1/resolve?q=Tantraloka
```

should search:

```text
exact external IDs
exact normalized titles
transliteration variants
alternate titles
authors
known aliases
bibliographic fingerprints
fuzzy search
semantic search
```

with explicit candidates rather than pretending certainty.

---

# 11. Build proper autocomplete

OpenAlex has a dedicated autocomplete API designed for fast UI typeahead, targeting roughly 200ms behavior. ([OpenAlex][3])

Copy it:

```http
GET /v1/autocomplete/works?q=tantr
```

Response:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "...",
      "display_name": "Tantrāloka",
      "hint": "Abhinavagupta · c. 10th–11th c.",
      "entity_type": "work",
      "external_id": "pandit:..."
    }
  ]
}
```

This powers your site and everybody else's.

---

# 12. Replace `WorkCompleteness` with `WorkCoverage`

This becomes your signature innovation.

Current code already contains the idea but implements it very weakly.

Make the final object:

```text
WorkCoverage
├─ identity
├─ authorship
├─ dating
├─ witnesses
├─ surrogates
├─ editions
├─ texts
├─ translations
│    ├─ eng
│    ├─ deu
│    ├─ fra
│    ├─ hin
│    └─ ...
├─ scholarship
├─ passage_structure
├─ rights
└─ evaluation
```

Each dimension gets:

```json
{
  "state": "PARTIAL",
  "confidence": 0.83,
  "evidence_count": 7,
  "last_checked": "...",
  "next_action": "SEARCH_TRANSLATION"
}
```

Now OpenPāṭala is not merely:

> what exists.

It knows:

> **what we do not yet know.**

That powers autonomy.

---

# 13. This is how the internet-scouring system should actually work

Do not create one free-running “crawler agent.”

Create a **self-filling graph**.

                 │          │
            expand     NegativeResult
```

That is the autonomous OpenPāṭala.

---

# 14. Structured harvesting before AI crawling

This matters enormously.

The agent should first look for machine-readable protocols.

Priority:

```text
native API
↓
DTS
↓
IIIF
↓
OAI-PMH
↓
TEI repository
↓
JSON-LD / structured HTML
↓
sitemap
↓
ordinary HTML extraction
↓
LLM-assisted extraction
```

DTS 1.0 was published in February 2026 specifically as a standard API for navigating and retrieving machine-actionable text collections. ([DTS API][4])

IIIF Presentation 3 exposes structured digital-object manifests, canvases and annotations suitable for manuscripts and scans. ([IIIF][5])

OAI-PMH exists specifically for metadata harvesting between repositories. ([Open Archives][6])

TEI remains the obvious interoperability representation for textual editions, including manuscript transcription and critical apparatus structures. ([Text Encoding Initiative][7])

Therefore OpenPāṭala shouldn't write bespoke scrapers for everything.

---

# 15. Build generic protocol adapters

Instead of:

```text
pandit.py
university_x.py
university_y.py
university_z.py
```

build:

```text
OaiPmhAdapter
IiifAdapter
DtsAdapter
TeiRepositoryAdapter
SitemapAdapter
JsonApiAdapter
GithubCorpusAdapter
HtmlCatalogAdapter
```

Then individual providers become mostly configuration.

Example:

```yaml
provider: example_library
transport: oai_pmh

endpoint:
  base_url: ...

mapping:
  title: dc:title
  creator: dc:creator
  identifier: dc:identifier

entity_policy:
  default_type: witness

rights:
  metadata_fetch: allow
  content_fetch: review
```

This is a major scaling trick.

---

# 16. Let agents discover providers, not directly create truth

Your discovery agent can scour:

```text
web search results
bibliographies
repository links
GitHub
institution sites
IIIF collections
OAI registries
DTS endpoints
sitemaps
known references in existing records
```

But the result is:

```text
SourceCandidate
```

not:

```text
new canonical Works
```

Schema:

```text
SourceCandidate
  id
  discovered_by
  discovery_run
  url
  possible_provider
  protocol_candidates[]
  sample_urls[]
  reason
  target_gaps[]
  confidence
  status
```

Then automatically test it.

---

# 17. Source adoption should itself be evaluated

You already have the right idea in `source_utilities`.

Give every provider:

```text
novelty_yield
works_per_request
identity_link_rate
artifact_yield
metadata_quality
structuredness
rights_clarity
authority_value
target_gap_match
failure_rate
cost_per_useful_record
```

Then:

```text
SourceUtility ≈
    novelty
  × target_gap_match
  × authority
  × structuredness
  × rights_clarity
  × identity_link_rate
  / acquisition_cost
```

Don't obsess about the exact equation.

Use the dimensions independently as well.

Now autonomous discovery becomes economically rational.

---

# 18. The key autonomous loop

This should literally run forever:

```text
for each Work:
    compute coverage

coverage emits gaps

rank gaps by:
    importance
    likely resolution
    downstream impact
    cost

attempt cheap deterministic resolution

attempt known structured sources

attempt web discovery

if source discovered:
    register candidate
    inspect terms/robots/protocol
    sample
    extract
    evaluate
    ingest if allowed

if no evidence found:
    record SearchPerformed
    record NegativeResult

schedule next search only when:
    sufficient time passes
    source changes
    new lead appears
    new model/tool capability appears
```

That negative-search history is part of the long-term moat.

---

# 19. A source search should leave evidence

Never merely set:

```text
translation = NONE
```

Instead:

```text
SearchEvent
  target: Tantrāloka
  objective: FIND_ENGLISH_TRANSLATION

  searched:
    Crossref
    OpenAlex
    Internet Archive
    WorldCat-like source
    Google Books-like source
    relevant catalogs
    bibliographic databases
    web search

  queries:
    ...

  timestamp:
    ...

  candidates_found:
    ...

  conclusion:
    NONE_CONFIRMED | CANDIDATE_FOUND | PARTIAL_FOUND
```

Then the API can distinguish:

```text
UNKNOWN
```

from:

```text
SEARCHED_NO_TRANSLATION_FOUND
```

That distinction is extremely valuable.

---

# 20. The canonical ingestion pipeline

Final ingestion should be:

```text
DISCOVERY
   │
   ▼
SourceResource
   │
   ▼
FETCH
   │
   ├──── exact bytes ────→ Artifact
   │
   ▼
RawObservation
   │
   ▼
ExtractionActivity
   │
   ▼
CandidateAssertions
   │
   ▼
EntityCandidates
   │
   ▼
Identity Resolution
   │
   ├─ exact match
   ├─ probable match
   ├─ ambiguous
   └─ genuinely new
   │
   ▼
Semantic Event
   │
   ▼
Canonical Assertions
   │
   ▼
Projection Compiler
   │
   ├─ WorkRecord
   ├─ PersonRecord
   ├─ WorkCoverage
   ├─ Search index
   └─ API changefile
```

**This is where the hard-core replay work belongs: underneath this flow.**

It should receive perhaps 10–15% of engineering attention now, not 90%.

```

That's enough.

Do not make 200 endpoints.

---

# 22. Make `/frontier` a real API product

This is where you become something OpenAlex isn't.

Examples:

```http
GET /v1/frontier?filter=has_text:true,translation.eng:none
```

means:

> show me Sanskrit works with usable e-texts but no known English translation.

Or:

```http
GET /v1/frontier?filter=witnesses:>0,surrogates:0
```

> manuscripts known but no known digitization.

Or:

```http
GET /v1/frontier?filter=identity:contested
```

> unresolved scholarly identities.

That endpoint is gold for:

```text
researchers
translation projects
digital humanities teams
AI agents
funders
institutions
your own Factory
```

---

# 23. Public changefiles and snapshots

Copy another great OpenAlex mechanism.

OpenAlex makes its dataset available as bulk snapshots and exposes incremental changefiles; its current snapshot is partitioned by entity and update date in JSONL, and changefiles are also offered in JSONL/Parquet. ([OpenAlex][8])

OpenPāṭala should publish:

```text
snapshots/
  2026-09-01/
    works.parquet
    people.parquet
    witnesses.parquet
    editions.parquet
    texts.parquet
    translations.parquet
    scholarship.parquet
    assertions.parquet
```

plus:

```text
changes/
  2026-09-02/
  2026-09-03/
```

JSONL + Parquet.

Now other researchers can mirror you.

That is how you become infrastructure.

---

# 24. Your public data and raw source data must remain separate

This matters because unlike OpenAlex, your raw material includes scans, texts and translations with heterogeneous rights.

Expose openly:

```text
canonical metadata
Pāṭala IDs
crosswalks
relationships
public-domain assertions
provenance metadata
coverage state
search history where safe
```

Raw content stays governed independently:

```text
READ
COMPUTE
DERIVE
REDISTRIBUTE
TRAIN
```

IIIF itself is designed to reference distributed resources rather than forcing every institution's content into one central store. ([IIIF][5])

So OpenPāṭala can know about a manuscript and deeply integrate it without owning the scan.

---

# 25. Search architecture: don't overengineer yet

For the current size:

```text
Postgres
+ pg_trgm
+ PostgreSQL full-text
```

is enough.

Build search documents:

```text
work_search
  id
  preferred_title
  normalized_titles[]
  transliteration_forms[]
  author_names[]
  external_ids[]
  traditions[]
  languages[]
  search_vector
```

Index:

```text
GIN(search_vector)
GIN(normalized_titles)
pg_trgm title indexes
B-tree external IDs
```

Only add a separate OpenSearch-like search cluster when measurement shows Postgres is the limiting factor.

---

# 26. But build the query layer independently of storage

Create:

```text
QueryAST
```

Example:

```text
filter=language:san,translation.eng:none
```

becomes:

```text
AND(
  Eq(language, "san"),
  Eq(translation.eng, NONE)
)
```

Then compile to Postgres today.

Later:

```text
PostgresCompiler
OpenSearchCompiler
ClickHouseCompiler
```

without changing the API.

That is actual future-proofing.

---

# 27. Read models are disposable

Do not make API performance query the assertion graph dynamically for every request.

Compile:

```text
work_current
person_current
witness_current
translation_current
work_coverage
work_counts
search_documents
```

These are denormalized.

Disposable.

Rebuildable.

Fast.

Permanent truth remains underneath.

---

# 28. Add analytical `group_by`

This sounds boring but is hugely important for market usability.

Examples:

```http
GET /works?group_by=tradition
GET /works?group_by=century
GET /works?group_by=source.state
GET /works?group_by=translation.eng
GET /witnesses?group_by=institution.id
```

OpenAlex makes filtering and grouping first-class throughout its API, which is why researchers can use it directly rather than downloading everything. ([OpenAlex][9])

Pāṭala should do the same.

---

# 29. Every web page uses the public API

This is another OpenAlex lesson: its public web interface sits directly over the same data/API product. ([OpenAlex][10])

Do:

```text
patala.org/work/...
patala.org/person/...
patala.org/witness/...
```

But the frontend fetches:

```text
api.patala.org/v1/...
```

No secret parallel backend.

Dogfood everything.

---

# 30. What the actual website should look like

Homepage:

```text
Search  [ Tantrāloka                         ]

23,842 works
...
```

Search result:

```text
Tantrāloka
Abhinavagupta · Sanskrit · Trika

TEXT       ✓
MANUSCRIPT 31
TRANSLATION partial
SCHOLARSHIP 84
```

Work page:

```text
OVERVIEW
TEXTS
MANUSCRIPTS
EDITIONS
TRANSLATIONS
SCHOLARSHIP
ARGUMENTS             ← later Pāṭala
HISTORY
```

And very visibly:

```text
WHAT'S MISSING
```

That last tab is uniquely yours.

---

# 31. Agent-native from day one

OpenAlex now even publishes an LLM-oriented quick reference for agents. ([OpenAlex][11])

Do better.

Ship:

```text
/openapi.json
/llms.txt
/docs
/mcp
```

MCP tools:

```text
patala_search
patala_resolve
patala_get_work
patala_get_bundle
patala_get_sources
patala_get_translations
patala_get_evidence
patala_get_frontier
patala_changes
```

An agent should need one sentence:

> “Find all source-ready untranslated Śaiva works.”

And be able to query OpenPāṭala directly.

---

# 32. SDKs

Generate from OpenAPI:

```text
patala-python
@patala/client
```

Developer experience:

```python
from patala import Patala

p = Patala()

works = p.works.list(
    filter="has_text:true,translation.eng:none"
)
```

and:

```python
work = p.works.get("...")
bundle = work.bundle()
```

---

# 33. The API business model

OpenAlex's current model is instructive: underlying data remains free, while its API is freemium and higher-frequency snapshots/change services are commercial services. ([OpenAlex][12])

I would do an even more aggressive adoption strategy initially:

```text
PUBLIC
metadata API
small/medium usage
snapshots
basic changefeed
MCP
non-commercial + academic use

PAID
high QPS
bulk entity resolution
large batch export
fresh changefeeds
private corpora
private institution reconciliation
custom ingest
SLA
advanced provenance/evidence API
commercial embeddings/search
benchmark/evaluation datasets
```

Do not sell access to copyrighted source content you don't control.

Sell the infrastructure.

---

# 34. The actual moat

Not API code.

Not FastAPI.

Not search.

Not LLMs.

Not even the event ledger.

The moat becomes:

```text
                 PĀṬALA ID
                     │
    ┌────────────────┼─────────────────┐
    │                │                 │
  PANDiT           GRETIL            IIIF
    │                │                 │
 Archive          Edition           Witness
    │                │                 │
Translation      Scholarship        Scan
```

plus years of:

```text
identity corrections
false-match history
expert decisions
translation-existence searches
failed searches
rights determinations
institution relationships
source lineage
source quality measurements
scholar contributions
```

A future model can regenerate your embeddings.

It cannot cheaply regenerate that history.

---

# 35. The thing to maximize is not Work count

Stop dashboarding:

```text
1099 Works
```

as the main success metric.

Instead track:

```text
Canonical Works
External records ingested
Cross-source links
Average providers / Work
Works with ≥2 sources
Works with usable e-text
Works with known witness
Works with translation status checked
Works with scholarship linked
Conflicting identities discovered
Conflicts resolved
Negative searches preserved
Freshness
```

The killer metric eventually is something like:

> **% of important Sanskrit works for which OpenPāṭala can reliably answer the full source/translation/manuscript/scholarship question.**

---

# 36. The next 90 days

This is where I'd radically alter the previous roadmap.

## Weeks 1–2 — Product spine

Stop adding infrastructure.

Make one 100-work gold corpus perfect.

For each:

```text
canonical Work
at least one provider observation
correct external ID
correct Work/Text distinction
real source availability
real translation status
bundle
coverage
```

Fix only as much replay/history infrastructure as necessary to make that data safe.

**Exit gate:**

```text
100 / 100 works return factually useful bundles.
```

Not “event test PASS.”

---

## Weeks 3–4 — OpenAlex-class API ergonomics

Implement:

```text
search
filter
sort
select
group_by
cursor
external-ID lookup
autocomplete
batch resolve
```

Delete placeholders.

`/frontier/translations` must use actual indexed evidence.

**Exit gate:**

A third-party developer can answer:

```text
all source-ready Sanskrit works
with no known English translation
by tradition
```

with one API request.

---

## Weeks 5–8 — Corpus acquisition

Now unleash structured ingestion.

Priority isn't “11 adapters.”

Priority is:

```text
number of useful canonical crosswalks
```

Bring in your strongest sources.

Each source record produces:

```text
Observation
→ Candidate
→ identity link
→ coverage gain
```

Use generic IIIF/DTS/OAI-PMH/TEI adapters where possible instead of bespoke crawlers. DTS and IIIF already give you standard interoperability surfaces for texts and digitized objects. ([DTS API][4])

Target:

```text
thousands → tens of thousands
of properly resolved Works,
not merely rows.
```

---

## Weeks 9–12 — Launchable OpenPāṭala

Ship:

```text
api.patala.org
patala.org search UI
OpenAPI docs
Python SDK
JS SDK
MCP
llms.txt
daily stats
snapshot
changefeed
public coverage dashboard
```

Then announce:

> **OpenPāṭala: an open graph and API for Sanskrit texts.**

That is a real launch.

---

# 37. Then autonomous OpenPāṭala

Only after the API/data product works:

```text
Coverage gaps
      ↓
TaskCandidates
      ↓
NRAH
      ↓
SourceDiscoveryAgent
      ↓
structured-source detection
      ↓
adapter selection/generation
      ↓
canary
      ↓
evaluation
      ↓
ingest
      ↓
coverage improves
```

Then it genuinely starts filling itself.

---

# 38. And then translation

At that point the existing Factory becomes enormously more powerful.

OpenPāṭala says:

```text
Work X
source = CLEAN_ETEXT
English translation = SEARCHED_NONE_FOUND
rights.compute = ALLOW
```

Automatically emits:

```text
GENERATE_TRANSLATION
```

Factory:

```text
SOURCE
→ L0
→ T1/ARGMAP
→ L1
→ L2
→ Eval
→ TranslationVersion
```

and writes its outputs back into OpenPāṭala as derived objects.

Now your translation system isn't a separate toy.

It's a consumer/producer of the graph.

---

# 39. Scholar product follows naturally

The system eventually identifies:

```text
translation disagreement
identity ambiguity
manuscript ambiguity
interpretive crux
```

and generates tiny review tasks.

Scholar says:

```text
accept
reject
qualify
uncertain
```

That becomes permanent epistemic capital.

This is where the Scholar Workbench we've spent all that time designing finally has a concrete reason to exist.

---

# 40. Then the argument/research graph

Once thousands of works have:

```text
stable identity
passages
translations
scholarship
```

you can reliably compile:

```text
Propositions
Arguments
Objections
Replies
Cruxes
Interpretations
OpenQuestions
```

Now Pāṭala stops being merely a catalog.

But **OpenPāṭala remains underneath it.**

---

# 41. Greek should be a proof of generality, not another startup

Once Sanskrit works end-to-end:

```text
PĀṬALA CORE
      │
      ├── Sanskrit profile
      │
      └── Greek profile
```

OpenGreekAndLatin/Perseus-like corpora become another provider family.

If you've modeled:

```text
Work
Witness
Edition
Text
Passage
Translation
Scholarship
```

correctly, Greek should require:

```text
new adapters
new resolver rules
new vocabularies
new evaluation profiles
```

not a new architecture.

That's the test that OpenPāṭala really became generic.

---

# 42. The eventual architecture

I would finally converge the repository to:

```text
openpatala/

packages/
  protocol/
    ids/
    schemas/
    relations/
    query/

services/
  ingest/
  identity/
  projection/
  search/
  coverage/
  discovery/
  api/

adapters/
  protocols/
    oai_pmh/
    iiif/
    dts/
    tei/
    sitemap/

  providers/
    gretil/
    pandit/
    ...
    
apps/
  web/
  docs/

integrations/
  mcp/
  python-sdk/
  js-sdk/

infra/
  postgres/
  object-storage/
  snapshots/
  observability/

proof/
  developer-tests/
```

Then keep the **independent release verifier outside this repository**.

---

# 43. Storage

Simple final stack:

```text
Postgres
  canonical entities
  assertions
  relations
  projections
  coverage
  source registry
  queues

R2 / S3-compatible object storage
  exact observations
  TEI
  permitted scans
  JSON snapshots
  Parquet snapshots
  large evaluator outputs

Postgres search initially
  FTS
  trigram

Redis
  optional hot caching only

Cloudflare/CDN
  cache public GET endpoints
  snapshots/content delivery
```

And later, only if needed:

```text
OpenSearch
→ giant full-text search

ClickHouse
→ huge analytics/group-bys
```

Not now.

---

# 44. The final boundary between OpenPāṭala and Pāṭala

This is probably the most important thing to lock after this entire conversation.

## OpenPāṭala owns

```text
IDENTITY

SOURCE REALITY

ARTIFACTS

OBSERVATIONS

PROVENANCE

RIGHTS

WORKS / PEOPLE / WITNESSES / EDITIONS

TEXT AVAILABILITY

TRANSLATION AVAILABILITY

SCHOLARSHIP INDEX

PASSAGE ADDRESSING

CROSSWALKS

CURRENT COVERAGE

CHANGE HISTORY
```

## Pāṭala proper owns

```text
translation generation

translation evaluation

arguments

interpretations

cruxes

OpenQuestions

agent research

scholar adjudication

education

media

self-improving agents

RealityRequests
```

OpenPāṭala **may expose outputs from all those systems**, but does not need to implement their intelligence.

That keeps it comprehensible.

---

# 45. The market attack

The sequence is:

```text
1. Become the easiest API for Sanskrit textual discovery.

2. Become the canonical crosswalk between existing Sanskrit databases.

3. Become the canonical place to answer:
   "is there a text / manuscript / edition / translation?"

4. Get developers and researchers using Pāṭala IDs.

5. Publish snapshots so other projects build on them.

6. Give institutions simple reconciliation:
   their ID ↔ Pāṭala ID.

7. Give scholars correction/attestation tools.

8. Use your own Factory to fill missing translations.

9. Use accumulated gaps to drive research.

10. Add adjacent textual traditions.
```

The moment datasets start including:

```text
patala_id
```

you are beginning to lock the graph.

That matters much more than having 50 fancy subsystems.

---

# 46. The single build objective I would give the agent now

Not:

> finish OpenPāṭala 0.6 replay infrastructure.

And not:

> implement the whole final Pāṭala vision.

Give it:

> **Turn `wiggly` into a market-usable OpenAlex-style API for Sanskrit textual resources. Make 100 curated Works genuinely excellent end-to-end, then generalize that path to bulk ingestion. Infrastructure work is permitted only when required to make those records trustworthy.**

And the binary product test is:

```text
Given a Sanskrit work name unknown to the caller:

1. /search finds it.
2. /resolve identifies it.
3. /works/{id} returns a stable useful record.
4. /bundle returns all known source types.
5. every external resource has provenance.
6. source/text/translation availability is evidence-backed.
7. /coverage accurately says what's missing.
8. /frontier can query those missing dimensions.
9. re-ingestion enriches rather than duplicates it.
10. another developer can reproduce the query through public docs.
```

**That is OpenPāṭala 1.0.**

Not an event ledger with 26 green gates.

---

## The north star

OpenAlex is currently an enormous graph of scholarship; its official docs say it indexes over 240 million works and exposes them through a standardized API, snapshots and related services. ([OpenAlex Help Center][13])

You do not need 240 million records.

You need to become the place where, for premodern textual traditions:

> **one Pāṭala ID resolves the chaos.**

Then the much bigger vision we developed starts to matter:

```text
OpenAlex tells an agent:

what scholarship exists?

OpenPāṭala tells it:

what textual reality exists?

Pāṭala eventually tells it:

what do we currently know,
why do we believe it,
what remains unresolved,
and what should intelligence do next?
```

That's the path.

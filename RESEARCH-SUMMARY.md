## Key Findings

### STAM + OpenPecha (highest priority)
- STAM assumes "information about a text is an annotation"
- Annotations can target text spans OR other annotations
- OpenPecha toolkit-v2 uses STAM for Buddhist textual corpora
- Separates base text from stand-off annotations
- **Directly relevant to Pāṭala TextAnchor/Annotation model**

### Explore Homer ATLAS
- ATLAS = Aligned Text and Linguistic Annotation Server
- Perseus 6 integrates morphology, syntax, named entities, alignments, annotations
- Structurally close to Pāṭala's passage-level annotation
- **But Pāṭala goes deeper: assertion → evidence → adjudication → dependency**

### MMM Data Conversion
- Bodleian TEI → CIDOC-CRM/FRBRoo → RDF pipeline
- Explicit transformation scripts
- **Model for how to ingest TEI into shared ontology**
- Pāṭala approach is stronger: observation → assertion → identity → projection

### Pairwise-light (KITAB)
- Massive text-reuse analysis across historical literature
- Pairwise reuse relationships
- **Potential DERIVED_FROM goldmine for Pāṭala**
- Could generate textual derivation/intertextuality graph

## Integration Points

| System | How to integrate with Pāṭala |
|---|---|
| STAM | TextAnchor adapter for stand-off annotations |
| OpenPecha | Collaborative annotation → Pāṭala assertions |
| ATLAS | Ingest annotations as EvidenceUse |
| MMM | TEI ingestion pipeline model |
| CollateX | Witness alignment → VariantGraph |
| KITAB | Text-reuse → DERIVED_FROM edges |
| Biblissima | Federated authority reconciliation |
